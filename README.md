# metro-navigator
The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent a metro station that will be containing certain information regarding that station like its name, its metro corridor, and the lines which it connects. Edges (the connection between two nodes) represent the distance between the two stations and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting stations(nodes).
